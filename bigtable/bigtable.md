# Bigtable

*A distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size.*

## Data Model

![data-model](images/data-model.jpg)

- Rows
  - read/write under a row key is atomic
  - row keys are in lexicographic order
  - tablet(row range) is unit of distribution and load balancing
- Column families
  - basic unit of access control
  - column family number is small and rarely change, while column number is unbounded

## Implementation

- Tablet Location

  - three-level hierarchy: Chubby file for root tablet, METADATA tablets, user table
  - client library caches tablet location(search recursively if cache is invalid)

- Tablet Assignment

  - tablet server creates file in Chubby directory; master monitors the directory to discover tablet server
  - when master starts, it creates file in Chubby directory, communicates with live tablet servers and scans METADATA table

- Tablet Serving

  - updates: commit log -> memtable -> SSTables
  - METADATA table stores metadata to recover a tablet(SSTables and redo points)

- Compaction
  - minor compaction: when memtable size reaches threshold, convert current memtable into a SSTable and make a new one
  - merging compaction: periodically merges a few SSTables and memtable into a SSTable
  - major compaction: merges all SSTables into a SSTable(no deletion entry)

## Refinements

- locality groups: group multiple column families into locality group; seprate locality groups into different SSTables
- compression
- bloom filter
- commit-log
  - use single commit log per tablet server, co-mingling mutations for different tablets
  - For recovery, the commit log is sorted first, so new tablet server doesn't need to read full log file
